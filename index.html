    <h2>Drawing Lines Using OpenGL and GLFW</h2>

    <p>Drawing lines in OpenGL is surprisingly not simple.  My GPU claims to be able to render lines in the range of [1,2048] pixels, but I can't guarantee that everyone else that uses my program will have the same line range(Some GPUs have a range of (1.0, 1.0], meaning you only have lines with 1px width)). This means that some users will see thicker lines than others (realistically, the other users are me on other computers). Your anti-aliasing options are also limited at best, with your only option being turning AA on or off with glEnable(GL_LINE_SMOOTH).</p>

    <p>So, what's the solution? Well, you draw your own lines using squares, of course. Here we will write a C program using GLFW to draw some smooth lines. As a line will be a collection of squares (the GPU will have to draw number-of-points - 1 squares) we will use instancing. If you don't know about instancing I recommend the <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Instancing">LearnOpenGL article about it</a></p>
